 
A sample demo that shows flappy bird clone.


The drawing of the sprites and backgrounds are rendered into a 2D layer using the 2D DMA hardware acceleration.
Rendering the sprites, however are  written using direct memory access to the frame buffer without a hardware DMA.
Rendering the background images, are written using the DMA hardware.

The source also contains a 3D Flat Shading Engine, that draws a 3D Cube with some lighting information.
